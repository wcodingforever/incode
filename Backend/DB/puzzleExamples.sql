Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.", "2018-08-23", "2018-09-23"),

This is taking the guessing game to a whole new level. This time, you're the one playing the guessing game. And the guessing game is Math.random(). The task is really simple. You make a guess, Math.random() does it's thing, and if you're right 5 times out of 5, you win! Don't guess the same thing every time. Hint: You guess first.", "2018-08-23", "2018-09-23");
